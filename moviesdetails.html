      <p>Oppenheimer was the 2023's best movie.I'll admit I had my doubts when
        I first heard that director Christopher Nolan was planning to make a film 
        about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the research effort to
        This is one of the most well-documented periods of 20th-century American history, 
        develop the first atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project.
        after all, and there have already been so many books, films, and TV series about
        the race for the bomb, of varying quality. (As always, let me give a shout-out
        to Manhattan, a stellar fictional series that was tragically canceled after just 
        two seasons.) How would Nolan make this very well-trodden material his own?
        
        I needn't have fretted. With Oppenheimer, Nolan has gifted us a truly unique,
        unflinching, nuanced portrait of the enigmatic, complicated man who spearheaded 
        the Manhattan Project and subsequently ran afoul of the "red-baiting" politics of
        the McCarthy era. Technically it's a biopic, but it doesn't play like one.
        It's more like Nolan carefully selected various threads running through Oppenheimer's 
        life and wove them into a richly textured tapestry that somehow transcends those raw materials.
        The result is pure visual poetry.
