      <p>Inception is a 2010 science fiction action film[4][5][6] written and directed by
         Christopher Nolan, who also produced the film with Emma Thomas, his wife. 
         The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a professional thief who steals information by 
         infiltrating the subconscious of his targets. He is offered a chance to have his
          criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a 
          target's subconscious.[7] The ensemble cast includes Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt,
           Marion Cotillard, Elliot Page,[a] Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Dileep Rao,
            and Michael Caine.

        After the 2002 completion of Insomnia, Nolan presented to Warner Bros. a written 80-page 
        treatment for a horror film envisioning "dream stealers," based on lucid dreaming.[8] Deciding 
        he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity, 
        Nolan shelved the project and instead worked on 2005's Batman Begins, 2006's The Prestige,
         and 2008's The Dark Knight.[9] The treatment was revised over six months and was purchased
          by Warner in February 2009.[10] Inception was filmed in six countries, beginning in Tokyo 
          on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22.[11] Its official budget was $160 million,
           split between Warner Bros. and Legendary.[12] Nolan's reputation and success with The Dark 
           Knight helped secure the film's US$100 million in advertising expenditure.
