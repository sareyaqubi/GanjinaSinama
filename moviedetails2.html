      <p>Fatherhood is a 2021 American comedy-drama film directed by Paul Weitz from a screenplay 
        by Weitz and Dana Stevens based on the 2011 memoir Two Kisses for Maddy: A Memoir of Loss
         and Love by Matthew Logelin. The film stars Kevin Hart, Alfre Woodard, Frankie R. Faison,
          Lil Rel Howery, DeWanda Wise, Anthony Carrigan, Melody Hurd, and Paul Reiser, and follows
           a new father who struggles to raise his daughter after the sudden death of his wife.

        Originally scheduled to be released in theaters by Sony Pictures Releasing, Fatherhood was 
        sold to Netflix during the COVID-19 pandemic and was digitally released on June 18, 2021. 
        The film received mixed reviews from critics, with criticism for its formulaic approach but
         the emotional weight and Hart's against-type performance receiving praise.
